buy
this

for

and
the
backlight
feature
but
the
clock
arrive
with
the
backlight
nonfunctioning
turn
out
the

not

would
advise
another
choice
this

look
great

functionally
terrible
alarm
clock
main
purpose
wake
you
this
clock
have
quiet
alarm
that
for
seconds
and
then
the
alarm
turn
off
automatically
never
sound
again
for

purchase
this
for

feature
but
the
alarm
poor
can
not
use
waste
money
own
the
previous
version
this
alarm
hop
upgrade
one
that
would
allow
for

where
there
would
alarm
weekend
version
have
through
long
menu
turn
off
just
wake
every
weekend
morning
the
new
version
have
the
same
problem
also
see
from
another
review
that
you
can
longer
wake
different
sound
than
you
fall
asleep
guess
just
keep
wait
till
they
figure
this
out
yup
you
can
have
the
alarm
off
lrb
not
rrb
different
time
different
day
the
week
definitely
cool
and
much
appreciate
pity
have
many
limitation
rrb
analog
tuner
and
hard
use
one
that
one
small
dial
all
you
get
you
must
analog
least
give
better
sensitivity
tuning
hard
and
seem
drift
over
time
rrb
too
make
that
worse
the
antenna
the
not
very
long
power
cord
this
mean
you
can
not
exactly
move
the
antenna
around
help
get
better
signal
and
the
tuner
crappy
this
compound
rrb
sound
quality
average
best
you
can
not
expect
much
from
something
this
small
but
its
worse
than
previous
alarm
which
better
really
crackly
high
and
almost
bass
rrb
the
volume
control
bias
really
high
for
alarm
clock
have
set
next
nothing
and
still
plenty
loud
for
listen
during
the
day
rrb
the
time

awful
dark
green
bright
green

lack
contrast
and
too
small
really
hard

any
time

night
decent

have
around
and
cheap
for
age
screw
this
really
sad
average
sound
the
two
simplest
control
lrb
tuner
and
volume
rrb
badly
and
the
display
suck
still
sure
you
want
this
buy
this
clock
for
aging
father
july
work
well
and
could
see
until
today
blank
nothing
the

replace
the
battery
even
though
have
plug
into
the
electrical
outlet
and
still
nothing
would
have
think
would
have
last
longer
than
month
piece
junk
very
disappoint
this
product
wish
have
not
wait
long
and
wish
still
able
send
back
the
product
very
difficult
use
without
manual
because
the
button
very
poorly
label
you
would
think
that
would
breeze
set
alarm
clock
that
have
only
time
day
and
alarm
its
function
not
there
button
none
they
label
hour
minute
alarm
they
label
mode
set
adjust
receive
what
that
mean
turn
out
that
very
simple
adjust
the
alarm
once
you
have
the
manual
you
just
have
memorize
all
the
counterintuitive
name
also
note
that
the
alarm
clock
not
set
itself
right
immediately
after
you
put
the
battery
set
itself
right
volition
after
while
sometimes
the
time
lag
before
set
itself
right
hour
there
way
set
the
time
manually
the
meanwhile
but
you
not
want
attempt
that
unless
you
have
memorize
the
manual
this
major
drawback
you
travel
often
and
you
have
take
off
the
battery
when
you
put
the
alarm
clock
the
suitcase
really
befuddle
the
fact
that
with
all
the
alarm
clock
that
label
clearly
enough
set
without
the
manual
this
one
not
and
technophobe
one
those

that
like
learn
about
all
the

night
alarm

who
think
these
thing
the
view
light
dim
that
you
can
not

that
not
problem
then
the
clock
logically
this

should
major

purchase
this

unfortunately
when
order
recently
have

return

very
appealing
alarm

however
the

disappointment
and
not

have
try

with
this

clock
for

have
just
order
new

also
notice
that
the

seep
out
the

the
plastic
the
top
and
back
even
the
quietest

still
too
loud

then
why

when
you
can

something
much
cheaper
that
the
same
thing
wish
would
have
have
the
option
return
but
not
buy
directly
from
sharper

and
frankly
determine
enjoy
this
fancy
alarm
clock
one
and
only
positive
very
easy
set
the
clock
time
and
alarm
time
bottom
line
not
recommend
see
brookstone
few
day
ago
and
totally
sell
the
idea
self
setting
well
that
actually
not
very
true
pro
large
display
with
adjustable
level
the
blue
display
also
look
lot
better
than
the
usual
green
red
the
alarm
easy
use
should
able
automatically
adjust
for
daylight
savings
time
con
brookstone
intentionally
vague
about
what
they
mean
self
setting
not
connect
the
atomic
clock
some
reviewer
say
merely
pre
set
the
factory
and
sustain
the
battery
you
look
they
manual
lrb
lrb
rrb
rrb
you
will
understand
why
you
reset
the
clock
will
not
reset
the
current
time
not
realize
this
until
try
out
the
feature
and
inadvertently
change
the
original
clock
think
reset
the
clock
will
adjust
back
automatically
nope
this
the
feature
that
think
worth
the
price
tag
but
now
just
feel
cheated
the
clock
use
battery
lrb
pre
installed
rrb
not
really
self
setting
while
store
the
day
month
year
info
there
way
show
they
the
clock
screen
and
lot
easier
and
more
tempting
turn
the
alarm
than
snooze
the
button
turn
off
lot
taller
than
the
snooze
button
overall
not
bad
one
even
not
really
automatic
just
wish
they
more
straightforward
about
what
really
get
this
clock
because
the
alarm
sound
call
chime
cathedral
bell
and
something
else
can
not
recall
but
turn
out
they
all
very
annoying
really
want
zen

indicator
light
the
bottom
right
the
clock
face
this
might
account
for
the
too
soft
alarm
volume
the
clock
receive
kitchen
clock
would
not
need
the
alarm
volume
that
bedroom
alarm
would
not
know
this
just
design
change
different
model
but
something
different
pleased
the
appearance
the
clock
when
first
arrive
but
within
the
first
hour
the
sweep
second
hand
have
break
off
and
within
hour
longer
work
all
try
play
around
with
the
battery
placement
after
read
other
review
but
get
nothing
look
great
but
very
shoddily
make
would
return
but
throw
out
the
packaging
would
not
purchase
again
probably
not
good
choice
for
sound
sleeper
the
alarm
this
clock
not
very
loud
measure
distance
foot
from
the
alarm
lrb
use
the
sound
meter
this
would
forgivable
the
alarm
persistent
but
shut
off
after
one
minute
operation
the
light
ineffective
you
will
not
able
read
the
time
this
clock
dark
room
without
external
light
source
addition
this
alarm
use
button
style
battery
form
factor
that
might
hard
locate
pinch
should
run
out
the
road
avoid
the
user
heavy
sleeper
better
than
alarm
clock
all
but
barely
buy
this
clock
and
try
for
night
however
awaken
the
clock
hour
ahead
actual
time
realize
later
that
the
manufacturer
have
mess
the
program
this
clock
instead
seconds
per
minute
this
alarm
clock
internally
set
seconds
per
minute
well
really
hope
would
work
out
with
this
clock
because
have
covet
for
some
time
despite
the
mixed
review
finally
decide
give
chance
when
get
gift
card
amazon
for
christmas
unfortunately
have
send
back
other
people
have
say
the
color
much
brighter
than
the
picture
lrb
the
pink
the
same
hue
the
photo
but
much
more
saturated
version
bit
more
bubblegum
than
salmon
rrb
and
there
silver
around
the
bottom
instead
the
white
the
pic
neither
those
thing
bother
the
clock
still
quite
cute
person
unfortunately
not
realize
that
the
face
always
light
and
you
can
not
adjust
the
brightness
similarly
the
audio
part
the
alarm
super
loud
and
non
adjustable
but
the
main
reason
return
that
just
never
seem
work
properly
sometimes
the
audio
alarm
would
off
without
the
light
part
flash
first
sometimes
both
would
happen
the
same
time
and
sometimes
the
light
would
flash
but
the
audio
would
not
ever
come
just
look
for
cute
clock
have
the
living
room
and
not
want
use
alarm
clock
definitely
would
have
keep
despite
its
flaw
but
for
purpose
just
not
match
really
bum
that
this
one
not
work
out
look
for
white
noise
machine
and
only
use
the
rain
and
white
noise
sound
and
they
loop
way
too
short
bit
neurotic
and
obsessive
about
little
thing
and
sensitive
pattern
the
rain
setting
about
second
loop
and
could
pick
out
faint
tap
tap
tap
and
course
focus
that
every
seconds
then
the
white
noise
set
which
have
even
fainter
problem
noise
even
shorter
loop
about
seconds
also
feel
that
even
the
lowest
noise
setting
not
quite
low
enough
lrb
have
the
clock
close
head
rrb
and
the
light
emit
the
clock
really
bright
even
when
turn
low
maybe
this
will
better
son
room
constant
hum
that
increase
the
backlight
setting
increase
but
even
the
lowest
the
three
backlight
setting
the
hum
too
loud
not
vary
with
the
volume
setting
any
case
bedside
night
this
the
last
thing
need
prevent
from
sleep
agree
with
other
who
write
the
audio
loop
not
sufficient
quality
would
cost
the
manufacturer
only
bit
more
install
higher
capacity
memory
circuit
provide
more
decent
audio
iregret
have
buy
this
product
title
say
everything
doubt
will
last
even
month
very
cheap
quality
not
deserve
even
single
star
wish
listen
the
review
that
here
already
this
this
make
feel
like
swim
sea
light
night
certain
angle
the
screen
look
like
rainbow
when
you
snooze
make
noise
the
entire
time
you
wait
for
the
alarm
off
again
good
cheap
chinese
product
the
concept
this
alarm
clock
great
idea
the
exterior
the
product
attractively
style
too
however
receive
defective
clock
the
minute
hand
would
not
change
the
time
the
clock
could
not
even
set
the
time
alarm
this
clock
the
button
the
clock
too
small
also
this
alarm
clock
fine
travel
clock
for
tell
time
but
unsatisfactory
alarm
clock
the
low
volume
beeping
noise
not
loud
enough
for
anyone
hear
unless
they
very
young
person
who
have
perfect
hearing
for
most
adult
worthless
alarm
clock
note
should
add
the
advertisement
for
this
clock
model
that
you
must
have
perfect
hearing
use
this
clock
alarm
clock
should
have
review
the
detail
more
closely
first
off
the
picture
misleading
this
clock
not
light
unless
you
hit
the
snooze
light
the
light
stay
for
few
seconds
this
not
what
look
for
very
cheap
and
when
you
try
check
the
time
the
dark
you
have
scramble
press
the
button
nope
junk
can
not
hear
alarm
even
press
ear
and
can
not
hear
that
pretty
bad
have
loudness
control
order
another
one
same
thing
call
the
mfg
she
even
admit
that
the
alarm
not
very
loud
this
model
not
very
loud
can
deal
with
but
silent
not
think
out
defective
not
good
deal
which
bad
because
really
like
the
big
red
clock
face
and
the
fact
that
set
itself
buy
this
despite
mixed
review
from
previous
customer
mention
other
gain
approximately
min
week
also
the
indiglo
display
isnt
that
great
very
hard
see
the
time
display
during
the
day
bottomline
always
look
through
customer
review
and
think
hard
and
long
product
you
consider
buy
have
bad
review
update
display
all
mess
after
just
one
battery
change
stay
away
from

have
never
take
the
time
make
review
but
must
say
great
design
great
option
lrb
alarm
rrb
everything
great
except
one
big
thing
read
this
problem
before
buy
this
took
chance
anyway
when
you
listen
the
nature
sound
any
one
about
minute
you
fall
asleep
then
wake
very
loud
pop
almost
like
shooting
noise
picture
feel
relaxed
falling
asleep
soft
nature
sound
then
wake
almost
like
popping
popcorn
right
next
your
ear
wake
husband
loud
scream
you
think
would
learn
the
time
try
different
nature
sound
lrb
think
just
that
song
recording
rrb
the
next
night
happen
again
both
times
does
not
happen
for
about
minute
hour
then
sleep
really
this
the
perfect
clock
not
have
this
issue
not
know
how
this
get
out
the
market
how
did
pass
inspection
get
this
clock
last
week
need
quiet
clock
for
bed
headboard
and
this
sound
like
also
interested
one
that
dark
till
you
push
button
illuminate
this
suppose
fit
the
bill
but
not
the
thing
arrive
perfect
packaging
and
look
fine
lrb
damage
rrb
add
battery
and
see
that
start
run
lrb
sweeping
second
hand
rrb
then
try
the
light
and
there
nothing
notice
that
the
switch
back
could
set
utilize
the
light
sensor
top
try
that
still
nothing
then
notice
that
the
clock
stop
run
light
tap
cause
start
run
again
open
the
battery
compartment
and
rotate
the
battery
few
time
hope
that
would
clean
off
some
the
contact
oxidation
seem
the
job
would
have
return
this
thing
but
seem
keep
pretty
good
time
test
its
accuracy
see
will
make
good
desk
clock
for
work
that
play
out
not
need
the
light
function
there
just
use
only
snooze
time
after
that
just
not
wake
again
defeat
the
entire
purpose
the
device
buy
this
for
husband
desk
work
want
get

see
picture
daughter

then
stop
work
completely
good
with
electronics
and
computer

the
problem
the

have
give
this
model
star
but
only
from
ease

standpoint
very
easy
master
technically
speak
but
term
functionality
this

stinker
the
dawn
simulator
only
emit
lumen
light
lrb
less
than
quarter
what
produce
forty
watt
lightbulb
rrb
wife
and
not
gently
awaken
such
paltry
little
light
lrb
just
roll
away
from

effectively
not
even
there
rrb
awake
the
jarring
sound
the
buzzer
every
morning
the

weak
fact
that
not
even
enough
keep
awake
addition
the
digital
clock
display
bright
that
have
fall
asleep
face
away
from
actually
cast
shadow
the

what
shame
that
the
extra

not
have
into
the
main
light
for
those
with
sad
lrb
who
just
can
not
seem
wake
winter

rrb
would
strongly
advise
you
purchase
different
product
this
one
just
not
the
trick
excite
when
find
this
sound
machine
and
could
not
wait
get
but
there
significant
problem
the
display
very
bright
but
hard
read
unless
you
face
the
clock
directly
prefer
the
rain
selection
but
level
too
quiet
and
level
really
loud
have
try
put

not
see
reach
the

several
time
the

switch
bird

purchase
this

for
son
birthday
present
work
well
when
first
get

work
for
the
first
few
hour
have
the

eventually
start
work
again
but
now
day
have
stop
make

again
will
try
contact
the

tomorrow
see
they
have
any
helpful
idea
what
hopefully
not
have
spend
ton
money
shipping
and
replace
product
that
only
work
one
day
the

issue
would
not

sound
wife

not
consistantly
the
alarm
light
not
work
who
perform
quality
control
this
thing
send
this
one

hope
this
example
lemon
biggest
complaint
the
clock
come
with
big
warning
sticker
tell
you
the
setting
knob
lrb
both
time
and
alarm
rrb
must
only
turn
one
way
indicate
the
arrow
the
back
avoid
damage
the
mechanism
not
know
about
you
but
none
old
analog
clock
require
you
turn
the
hand
one
way
only
addition
just
lazy
enough
want
reach
around
the
clock
and
turn
the
adjustment
knob
without
look
they
gosh
sure
hope
not
inadvertantly
spin
they
the
wrong
way
and
wreck
the

especially
this
price
note
this
clock
make
china
and
feel
cheaply
make
dave
update

about
month
now
and
acceptably
accurate
have
upgrade
this
review
star
the
clock
still
retain
the
cheap
feel
and
restrictive
alarm
setting
requirement
but
more
important
this
have
most
annoying
alarm
for
clock
design
sooth
you
awake
this
one
make
you
grind
you
tooth
wife
use
another
clock
she
alarm
but
keep
this
one
the
nightstand
because
she
like
the
retro
look
still
only
two
star
but
that
improvement
over
initial
assessment
not
know
why
this
say
that
loud
really
not
kind
disappointed
buy
for
friend
who
deep
sleeper
and
hope
wake
the
dead
with
the
sound
but
the
alarm
husband
buy
wal
mart
for
about
louder
think
the
only
reason
someone
would
want
this
for
the
bed
shaker
attachment
but
definitely
not
the
alarm
tone
annoy
but
not
too
loud
think
phone
ring
louder
than
this
buy
this
alarm
clock
for
daughter
who
big
who
fan
look
like
real
dalek
but
the
quality
really
cheap
the
sound
only
work
for
short
time
break
after
few
hour
now
only
have
the
light
effect
what
alarm
clock
without
sound
will
send
back
tomorrow
poor
quality
for
lot
money
product
failure
never
work
correctly
the
clock
work
but
would
never
reset
from
pacific
time
zone
eastern
time
zone
try
everything
could
but
could
never
get
move
off
pacific
time
buy
this
alarm
clock
for
young
daughter
oct
she
sleep
with
white
noise
and
think
that
buy
clock
with
the
noise
feature
build
would
both
space
saving
and
money
saving
look
nice
and
easy
use
however
other
reviewer
have
say
the
volume
setting
not
ideal
set
its
very
quiet
its
annoyingly
loud
nice
have
the
dual
alarm
set
the
second
alarm
for
put
she
bed
and
when
the
bird
chirp
she
know
put
she
book
down
its
light
out
but
any
dual
alarm
will
serve
that
purpose
with
without
fancy
noise
and
here
the
worst
part
march
one
random
morning
the
alarm
never
off
for
school
and
addition
she
too
loud
white
noise
the
clock
make
horrible
buzz
sound
which
can
not
shut
off
unplug
and
remove
the
battery
but
when
reinstall
the

the

mess
and
play
sound
constanly
lrb
very

soother
but
least
half
the
pre

annoy
purchase
for
the
white
noise
sound
but
the
most
annoying
setting
all
also
the
volume
level
only
down
far
that
even
the
sound
like
too
loud
consider
background
noise
lrb
which
what
expect
rrb
great
detail
nice
lead
light
but
like
two
the
other
review
this
one
stop
make
any
sound
after
two
day
the
picture
this
jukebox
alarm
clock
bit
misleading
somewhat
smaller
than
expect
and
look
like
cheap
novelty
toy
but
since
decorate
one
guest
room
the
music
room
this
fit
right
battery
operate
which
drawback
for
alarm
clock
you
really
depend
wake
time
have
provision
for
battery
backup
the
main
battery
die
the
song
play
snippet
the
original
artist
and
kinda
fun
let
get
this
straight
alarm
clock
for
the
shower
who
fall
asleep
the
shower
you
fall
asleep
the
shower
late
the
least
you
problem
maybe
gauze
dispenser
for
patch
that
crack
skull
would
bit
more
handy
how
bout
coby
have
look
for
inexpensive
clock
radio
with
headphone
jack
and
think
have
find
one
very
disappointed
when
open
the
box
and
could
not
find
the
headphone
jack
anywhere
there
headphone
jack
show
the
owner
manual
include
the
box
the
box
state
headphone
jack
but
there
jack
this
unit
return
this
amazon
and
order
the
phillips
you
look
for
clock
radio
use
headphone
with
would
not
purchase
this
coby
model
like
the
design
but
without
headphone
jack
can
not
use
the
control
good
and
like
the
way
the
display
light
when
you
press
the
snooze
light
but
this
not
really
good
travel
alarm
too
big
and
clunky
and
the
alarm
not
very
loud
buy
this
clock
because
some
the
other
review
say
that
the
alarm
loud
but
not
might
work
regular
bedside
alarm
you
light
sleeper
end
buy
little
casio
travel
alarm
much
better
much
smaller
size
and
loud
alarm
need
small
clock
for
bathroom
could
keep
track
the
time
the
morning
while
put
makeup
and
this
nice
look
little
clock
perfectly
fine
for
about
month
then
notice
that
always
happen
look
the
clock
when
think
that
pretty
funny
coincidence
until
realize
that
the
clock
just
stick
you
can
see
that
try
the
second
hand
attempt
keep
tick
but
something
hold
back
fear
anxiety
well
whatever
the
reason
this
little
clock
just
will
not
get
and
apparently
can
not
return
not
buy
save
yourself
the
aggravation
and
the
possibility
extremely
late
for
work
buy
this
product
because
the
selection
sound
offer
have
listen
the
sample
provide
online
however
the
main
reason
for
purchase
white
noise
machine
for
night
sleep
think
good
plus
that
also
come
with
alarm
clock
while
appreciate
the
functionality
that
you
could
set
the
alarm
for
any
sound
you
wish
lrb
sleep
with
white
noise
but
wake
with
wind
chime
rrb
dissatisfy
with
the
sound
quality
the
white
noise
the
brightness
the
display
could
discern
the
loop
the
white
noise
not
continuous
smooth
fact
get
one
the
most
restless
night
sleep
use
this
machine
overall
you
look
for
sound
machine
with
lot
interesting
noise
this
for
you
you
look
for
white
noise
machine
this
not
for
you
have
this
for
little
over
week
nothing
but
problem
time
would
not
set
properly
only
play
when
want
real
piece
junk

terrible
product
the
clock
run
fast
gain
minute
every
few
day
the

skip
the
slightest
vibration
from
when
walk
across
room
when
someone
open
the
door
building
floor
below
frequently
wake
noise
like
fan
with
something
stick
the
blade
rather
than
anyone
who
look
for
reliable
clock
player
would
better
spend
few
extra
dollar
buy
something
that
actually
work
buy
this
alarm
clock
sit
the
edge
bed
wonder
why
new
alarm

but
you
want

skip
this
clock
have
own
this
light
for
few
year
now
and
use
occasionally
when
feel
need
set
circadian
rhythm
but
never
that
impressed
the
plug
huge
and
the
light
get
extremely
hot
which
always
worry
the
radio
not
digital
dial
and
dial
break
long
ago
can
not
even
see
what
station
try
tune
into
the
light
nice
fall
asleep
help
wind
down
but
the
light
not
bright
enough
wake
without
the
backup
alarm
the
glow
the
clock
also
too
bright
and
have
face
that
away
from
cover
with
something
actually
have
dark
room
needless
say
shop
for
something
new
replace
this
timex
indiglow
travel
alarm
finally
die
buy
this
elgin
clock
specifically
because
have
the

amazon
great
crap
make
china
not
the
universal
standard
for
clock
reliability
the
single
battery
easily
dislodge
stop
the
clock
although
like
the
fact
that
analog
with
retro
style
poorly
engineer
and
shoddily
manufacture
additionally
take
over
six
week
for
delivery
purchase
this
clock
replacement
for
older
timex
travel
alarm
clock
that
lose
while
this
model
function
basic
level
disappointing
overall
another
reviewer
mention
this

gain
time
quickly
after
just
couple
day
will
minute
ahead
the
actual
time
you
only
use
the
clock
for
weekend
trip
this
probably
will
not
much
inconvenience
but
for
longer
trip
regular
use
home
this
bit
nuisance
can
honestly
say
that
entire
life
have
never
have
any
clock
watch
other
appliance
poor
keep
the
correct
time
have
also
disappoint
with
the

the

this

last

indiglo
watch
the

make
the

however
this
clock
the
indiglo

feeble
comparison
just
bright
enough
qualify
usable
but
you
eyesight
not
great
the
combination
the
weak
backlight
and
the
fact
that
you
probably
not
wear
contact
glass
the
middle
the

may
make
this
clock
difficult
for
you
read
far
the
user
interface
concern
the
time

very
large
but
other

such
the

suffer
from

certainly
purchase
different

this
extremely

cheap
and
the

certainly
not
worth
the

but
return
and

the

for
about
month
before
the
snooze
button
stop
work
lrb
not

back
brookstone
and
get
pair

not

useless
alarm
clock
mine
when

such
low

that
you
can
happily
sleep
through
the
entire

and
wake
two
hour
later
without
even
notice
additionally
would
suppose
when
you
not
hear
the

the
first

buzz
again
minute
interval
not
simpler
word
only
sound
for
less
than

make
china
alarm
clock
that
reliable
humble
and
not

with
the
optional

which
turn
another

that
really
help
make
the

dawn
usably
bright
but
the

after
about
year
the
idea
wake

like

work
really
well
for
but
this
product
cheaply
make
and
another

would
likely
better
choice
the

very
poor
have
take
apart
and
pull
the
coil
internal
antenna
wire
out
and
drape
the
wall
get
any
reception
and
live
major
metro
area
with
many
strong

the
scratchy
reception
may
more
effective
annoy
awake
than
the

the
product
could
really
good
with
infusion
better
quality
think
the
idea
fabulous
get
for

amazon
issue

see
this
radio
target
and
think
look
really
cool
like
the
old
fashioned

and
the
blue

unfortunately
quickly
find
two
major
problem
with
this
someone
state
earlier
the

too
bright
light
room
like
full
moon
and
there
seem
way
turn
down
the
second
major
problem
that
the

dial
not
turn

rather
notch
such
way
that
there
really
way
control
the
volume
the
unit
have
either
the
volume
down
all
the
way
okay
the
first
notch
and
way
too
loud
the
second
notch
like
the
nature
sound
but
the
bird
sound
rather
silly
because
they
sound
like
snippet
from
dozen
different
habitat
and
distract
the
flowing
water
sound
nice
though
tuning
interesting
because
the
frequency
increment
from
you
have
push
the
button
four
time
instead
just
once
while
this
not
issue
one
frequency
annoy
lastly
the

out
the
second
night
the
radio
absolutely
useless
this
point
the

not
grant
not
advertised

but
feel
that
something
that
come
along
with
the
product
from
the
other
review
have
read
reality
this
regular
alarm
clock
that
wake
you
with

choice
beep
nature
sound
not
what
want
this
one
get
big
thumb
down
works
okay
alarm
clock
but
the
clock
display
way
too
bright
and
annoying
talk
about
the
actual
digital
time
display
not
the

avoid
any
possible
confusion
here
have
put
piece
duct
tape
over
really
sensitive
light
bedroom
when
try
sleep
keep
mind
that
have
the

money
have
always
huge

product
make

because
they
product
high

base
the
review
optimistic
and
willing
forgive
the

definitely
fall
short
for
reason
lrb
rrb

the
next
reason

put
towel
over
the
clock
keep
the
room
dark
the
difference
between
the

but
not
live
its
description
the
clock
run
fast
and
the

cheap
the
built
light
very
small
and
dim
get
the

able
use
own

addition
and
this
provide
enough
light
but
still
have
problem
with
first
the

increase
step

the
increase
noticeable
and
jolt
awake
too
fast
second
the

not
work
properly
for

set
reach

start
the

early
shut
off
the

completely
and
turn
back
full
brightness
again
not
exactly
gradual

process
would
not
recommend
this

all
there

much
better

that
not
cost
that
much
more
than
this
with

and
never
much

bitterly
disappointed
phooey

never
get
loud
and
sometimes
not
even
work
all
where
the

unfortunately
the

have
serious
design
flaw
the
little
vent
for
the
alarm

the
bottom
the

with
the

anemic
have

set
clock
off
this
morning
test
the

one
might
think
the
moron
who
design
these
clock
could
have
guess
that
put
the
alarm
vent
spot
where
cover
not
good
idea
see
some
complaint
about
this
problem
with
weak

but
think
they
might
exaggerate
they
not
this
thing
dud
alarm
clock
you
would
better
off
buy

more
overall
cheap

very
disappointed
the

work
well
especially
because
the
tuner
digital
switching
from
store
memory
station
bit
complex
overall
the
radio
complicate
use
and
the
instruction
not
very
clear
the
most
troubling
part
this
device
that
the
radio
alarm
only
off
for
about
minute
lrb
have
not
figure
out
anyway
lengthen
the
alarm
time
rrb
and
unless
have
loud
sleep
through
the

advise
that
you
can
afford
buy

keep
with

clock
and
the
nature

hear
bleed
through
when

just
slight
but
its
annoying
its

force
return
the

defective
bottom

very
cheaply

too
big
for
travel
clock
the
digital

anlaog
clock
not

and
the
other

awkward
use
the

very
cute

very
near

can
barely
see
the
face
order
tell
the
time
unless
have
about
six
inch
away
the
backlighting
rather
pathetic
addition
there
should
more
distinction
between
the
minute
and
hour
hand
even
with
glass
during
day
can
difficult
tell
whether
finally
the
light
not
wake
might
have
the

have
dark
the
alarm
terrify
both
cat
right
off
the

try
cover
the

with
small
pillow
and
sleep
through
part
the
problem
that
wear
earplug
but
wish
there
way
adjust
the
loudness
the
alarm
really
disappointed
and
would
reiterate
that
the
clock
need
brighter
backlight
adjustable
brightness
feature
and
one
the
hand
need
thicker
distinguish
between
they
keep
but
not

rrb
but
the
mere

have
experience

clock
but
realize
after
toy
with
some
more
that
the

actually
not
burn
out
that
the
machine
itself
actually
fail
would
take
the
bulb
out
put
back
jiggle
bit
and
then
test
run
the
lamp
cycle
and
would
illuminate
then
would
continue
wake
for
couple
day
row
and
then
stop
work
again
this
type
inconsistency
just
not
acceptable
alarm
clock
product
the
thing
that
even
more
annoying
about

not
cheap
one

take
leap
faith
that
the
product
will
function
suppose
this
case
that
leap
right
off
cliff
what

rrb
attractive
retro
look
that
would
blend
with
bedroom
yeah
sure
this
product
have
that
chrome
look
and
retro
ish
design
but
its
tiny
size
make
seem
more
like
travel
alarm
clock
and
the
cheap
material
show
the
appearance
rrb
easy
read
face
that
would
allow
see
the
time
quickly
when

surprised
see
the
flowery

the

comment
the

this

may
seem
stylish
but
not
free
from
glithe
and
error
the

reception
very
weak
the
only

touch
the

hopeful

will
help
someone
make
different
choice
when
purchase
from
this
company
small
not

all

really
really
bother
you

may
work
lot
money
for
very
little
product

setting
and
the
radio
preset
also
lose
this
great
idea
this
kind
thing
work
for
you
might
not
work
for
everyone
though
the
problem
here
that
this
cheap
lrb
and
poorly
design
rrb
clock
radio
with
lightbulb
for
that
you
pay
ton
money
this
would
fine
but
for
the
price
you
would
expect
more
the
button
small
and
hard
use
never
get
terribly
bright
although
guess
you
could
read
lrb
the
wife
although
she
use
just
use
flashlight
rrb
but
there
something
nice
about
get
with
that
even
increase

middle
the
night
wake

hear
strange
whir
noise

brief
description

considerably
bigger

switch
the
side
which
mean
possible
turn
off
while
reach
for
the
light
button
light
bright
you
enable
the
sensor
the
light
will
turn
when
get
dark
not
want
this
feature
but
you
want
bright
light
all
night
seem
work
fine
first
they
absolutely
silent
the
quiet
one
seem
the
other
will
return
love
the
look
this
clock
but
will
simply
stop
run
without
warning
not
slowly
loose
time
stop
get
week
ago
and
have
put
least
different
battery
think
they
dead
battery
all
fine
they
power
other
item
something
wrong
inside
battery
fit
tight
must
beyond
where
the
battery
buy
this
month
ago
base
the
previous
reviewer
buy
early
this
gift
for
daughter
high
school
graduation
think
this
would
great
college
gift
well
month
later
she
open
take
she
room

and
the
time
speed
during
the
night
you

etc
get
lemon
throw
the
trash
within
month
purchase
this
item
the

control
the
alarm
mode
would
get
stick
and
difficult
set
six
month
later
the
sound
stop
work
altogether
good
product
while
last
but
for
the
price
should
have
last
longer
must
make
china
when
pay
for
travel
alarm
clock
surely
expect
that
will
excellent
quality
when
mine
arrive
dead
right
out
the
box
call
the
company
and
tell
that
would
have
accept
merchandise
credit
rather
than
refund
would
every
buy
anything
else
from
they
save
you
money
this
company
obviously
not
care
about
quality
