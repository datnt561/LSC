the
other
thing
that
the

still
work
clock
rrb
some
research
think
that
there
must
slightly
more
technologically
advanced
alarm
clock
that
would
prefer
however
the
end
weigh
increase
cost
and
mediocre
review
decide
with
the
alarm
clock
know
and
could
trust
love
that
can
fold
and
put
suitcase
without
worry
break
and
that
easy
set
lrb
though
perhaps
might
nice
you
could
and
down
instead
just
when
change
the
setting
rrb
and
use
hope
this
one
last
another
year
update
year
later
this
alarm
clock
start
shift
time
oddly
the
time
itself
would
correct
but
set
the

for
the

would
reset

generally
the
and
not
regular
interval
lrb
sometimes
sometimes
rrb
contact
acehardwareoutlet
who
very
understand
and
send
replacement
just
arrive
here
hope
the
price
right
this
clock
the
size
perfect
especially
when
fold
for
packing
and
take
with
sit
good
angle
when
open
and
the
backlight
sufficient
the
alarm
tone
sufficient
wake
you
course
personal
opinion
work
for
but
might
not
work
for
you
you
heavy
sleeper
would
also
knock
the
battery
choice
coin
type
versus
aaa
worry
how
quickly
that
coin
battery
will
die
since
habitual

snoozer

sad
defect

too
this

just
what
look
for
easy

and
have
small
footprint
nightstand
would
easily
fit
you
pocket
purse
when
close
measure
just
under
come
with
button
battery
rather
than
the
more
easy
replace
aaa
battery
since
have
idea
how
long
the
battery
will
last
decide
just
buy
new
battery
and
keep
hand
the
nightstand
drawer
the
energizer
model
lrb
also
exp
rrb
these
battery
sell
hardware
store
radio
shack
etc
can
really
only
think
one
reason
that
make
this
timex
solar
powered
radio
controlled
atomic
alark
clock
worth
invest
the
fact
solar
power
which
mean
whenever
the
electric
out
lrb
which
happen
frequently
the
summertime
thanks
lightning
storm
activity
rrb
you
not
have
worry
about
you
wake
time
disrupt
delay
thanks
battery
the
alarm
will
off
anyway
the
radio
alright
but
nothing
flashy
distinct
and
the
clock
itself
light
that
can
fall
off
the
shelf
easily
careful
when
handle
have
use
background
noise
machine
for
all
child
help
they
nap
through
other
noise
the
house
this
the
best
one
far
and
highly
recommend
use
fairly
low
volume
with
either
the
white
noise
babble
brook
sound
setting
and
work
like
charm
you
can
set
seperate
alarm
and
the
illuminate
clockface
have
adjustable
brightness
level
love
neverlate
fact
have
two
the
house
the
radio
sound
really
good
comparison
most
alarm
clock
and
obviously
able
set
different
alarm
time
for
each
day
the
week
pretty
cool
this
clock
great
idea
and
work
very
well
receive
this
gift
for
christmas
and
have
lot
fun
have
around
the
house
for
someone
who
big
who
fan
would
definitely
recommend
buy
this
alarm
clock
for
nothing
more
then
able
exterminate
anyone
nearby
not
use
this
anything
more
then
the
less
practical
enjoyment
factor
use
more
traditional
and
trust
clock
that
can
reliably
get
work
time
overall
the
clock
have
good
detail
and
have
nice
handy
light
that
can
work
dark
semi
dark
room
like
the
sound
that
make
however
limit
only
three
distinct
and
repeat
noise
the
favorite
always
exterminate
you
need
use
this
for
practical
application
then
warn
that
will
require
some
patience
learn
how
program
and
maintain
the
different
setting
the
clock
make
rather
flimsy
material
and
very
light
for
its
size
have
not
have
any
issue
with
the
sound
use
the
clock
frequently
can
not
comment
the
longevity
the
dalek
suggest
you
have
traditional
alarm
clock
use
you
cell
phone
like
lot
people
then
keep
both
you
look
for
fun
toy
nice
night
side
adornment
then
look
further
large

buy
this
for

and
rrb
they
can
see
the
time
easily
when
they
wake
night
have
many
other
feature
but
they
just
like
the
very
large
number
and
the
strong
elimination
really
great
item
that
neighbor

about
she
have
one
that
she
have

have
trouble
sleep
and
ruby
lrb

operation
for
the
hour
minute

and
the

the
only
problem
with
ours
that
after
few
hour
work
normally
the
hour
minute
hand
freeze
could
still
turn
the
knob
set
the
time
but
then
the
hand
would
not
turn
automatically
send
back
for
new
one
hopefully
that
one
will
fine
very
good
opinion
because
rrb
use

this
just
nice
rrb
annoying

tune
they
out
tune
that
you
will
scare

there
just
two
thing
wrong
with
this
product
the

very

you
nearsighted
the

tall
number
difficult

than

the

guess
have
get
that
lasik
surgery
after
all
have

they
have
take
lot
abuse
lrb
have
two
small

yes
the

setting
can
off
bit
but
consistently
the
same
amount
once
you
figure
out
how
much
you
can
easily
make
the
correct
adjustment
small
inconvenience
opinion
consider
the
cost
and
overall
quality
they
keep
the
time
accurately
also
nice
snooze
and
crescendo
feature
not
too
annoying
but
loud

all
great
value
update

and
notice
they
longer
have
the

will
see
the
reliability
the

before

clock
few
day
ago
and
have
say
really
like
the
visual
detail
great
the
design
just
like
the
new
daleks
from
the
new
doctor
series
you
have
the
right
larger
base
the
more
prominent
band
around
the
arm
and
the
yellow
for
the
eye
stalk
well
the
base
dot
with
the
orb
even
the
clock
there
durability
wise
bit
the
light
side
and
feel
bit
flimsy
especially
the
arm
which
almost
feel
like
they
mean
come
off
and
might
any
second
alarm
clock
work
great
the
button
conceal
the
orb
the
base
and
project
the
time
the
cealing
when
you
press
down
the
dalek
there
three
alarm
sound
plus
the
classic
shout
exterminate
after
year
life
with
the
doctor
that
doesnot
get
you
move
nothing
will
luckily
turn
off
the

you
have
press
the
demo
button
the
side
give
you
chance
dodge
the
death
ray
you
can
start
you
new
day
alive
and
well
only
real
complaint
this
morning
when
alarm
off
hear
this
whooshing
noise
outside
then
the
doctor
burst
and
take
the
dalek
away
shout

though
the

between

have
put
black

which
good
job
hide

when
look
straight

however
they
still
visible
from

wish
could
turn

this
replace
the

radio
have
have
since
the
never
listen
wake
music
because
husband
need
bomb
get
out

for
some
reason
hear
the
click
which
very
faint
and
start
very
low
first
increase

not
turn
off
the
dual

great
and
easy
set
and
the

from
very
bright
faint
even
off
with
push

since
the

bother
night
turn
off
but
need
just
touch
the
snooze
button
show
the
time
for
few
seconds
test
the
clock
when
first
get
make
sure
loud
enough
wake
and
more
than
sufficient
even
though
hear
earlier
really
like
this
little
clock
fold
flat
anywhere
easy
use
and
emit
distinct
beep
sound
for
the
alarm
which
loud
enough
wake
you
yet
not
totally
obnoxious
love
simple
yet
such
great
idea
finally
someone
have
really
think
about
how
people
use
alarm
clock
love
able
program
and
not
worry
about
forget
change
the
night
before
great
for
odd
time
class
grad
school
and
now
use
get
early
twice
week
for

good
for

too
not
have
remember
shut

can
sleep
saturdays
and
not
have
remember
turn
again
for
monday
also
look
lot
cooler
than
most
the
other
clock
out
there
try
purchase
another
have
disappoint
find
the
timex
solar
alarm
out
stock
amazon
thankfully
still
available
elsewhere
but
the
thought
that
this
clock
might
discontinue
motivate
write
review
because
great
clock
know
there
people
complain
that
not
connect
very
well
when
you
try
have
set
itself
automatically
but
not
buy
for
that
purpose
and
easy
enough
set
manually
that
hard
for
understand
why
that
should
big
deal
especially
since
depend
where
you
live
whether
can
connect
and
its
not
really
timex
fault
that
live
new
england
lrb
pretty
darn
far
from
colorado
rrb
the
snooze
only
five
minute
increment
that
something
aware
sometimes
when
want
keep
push
snooze
for
while
lrb
but
can
not
turn
off
the
alarm
would
oversleep
rrb
reach
for
the
alarm
and
set
beside
the
bed
lrb
since
cordless
and
very
light
rrb
that
can
snooze
the
first
beep
also
agree
with
another
reviewer
that
all
the
little
beep
when
set
check
the
alarm
setting
unnecessary
and
mildly
annoying
but
more
than
willing
accept
they
because
after
read
hundred
review
for
other
clock
lrb
upon
see
this
one
out
stock
rrb
become
even
more
convinced
than
already
that
there
not
another
alarm
clock
out
there
that
compare
this
one
what
love
about
this
clock
not
glow
some
bright
color
all
night
and
keep
husband
and
awake
when
need
see
the
time
the
dark
have
button
that
cover
the
top
lrb
you
can
not
miss
even
when
fumble
around
because
you
half
asleep
rrb
that
can
press
and
illuminate
the
time
perfect
non
sleep
disturbing
amber
this
very
important
since
sleep
get
mess
easily
lrb
the
body
light
sensor
that
regulate
circadian
rhythm
very
sensitive
blue
green
white
light
but
red
amber
have
barely
any
effect
which
exactly
what
you
want
night
the
morning
those
other
color
good
since
they
promote
wakefulness
but
not
expect
want
alarm
clock
perform
for
the
work
lamp
light
box
rrb
also
like
that
this
clock
show
the
date
day
the
week
and
room
temperature
the
bottom
the
display
addition
the
larger
display
the
time
sometimes
when
think
about
what
set
hall
thermostat
night
helpful
see
what
the
temperature
currently
bedroom
first
another
thing
appreciate
how
this
silver
color
clock
look
bedside
table
really
look
attractive
compare
all
the
black
alarm
you
see
the
one
that
glow
odd
color
stand
out
for
its
elegance
have
cord
get
the
way
battery
change
with
past
clock
that
glow
would
end
turn
the
clock
face
against
the
wall
but
here
there
need
always
position
well
perfect
size
petite
but
not
too
small
blank
cube
that
look
pretty
good
then
you
tap
clap
you
hand
and
the
time
show
for
seconds
then
blank
again
inconvenient
night
when
you
have
someone
sleep
next
you
for
obvious
reason
great
present
for
annoying
people
who
like
walk
around
clap
they
hand
singing
song
while
you
try
watch
the
files
bring
they
hour
enjoyment
kinda
boring
not
work
excavator
nuclear
launchpad
seem
cooler
when
buy
but
bonus
point
for
innovative
and
feng
shuus
buy
this
clock
replace
the
one

have
for
the
past
year

best
all
when

have
fun
through
listen
they
and
there
plenty
good
one
there
the
back
light
means
too
bright
the
whole
display
light
and
that
seem
unnecessary
but
certainly
not
too
bright
very
picky
about
that
have
not
try
use
sound
for
the
alarm
because
have
the
past
and
they
work
they
way
into
dream
and

star
but
not
like
the

you
can
adjust
tone
and
volume
but
sound
bit
like
smoke
alarm
something
just
not
thrill
with
the
sound
addition
the
color
the
picture
not
represent
the
actual
product
opinion
think
hot
pink

this
particular
pink
otherwise
very
happy
with
the
product
this
clock
amazing
lot
research
these
clock
and
have
biobrite
before
this
and
convince
this
the
best
choice
the
light
the
morning
help
wake
more
naturally
find
the
light
plenty
bright
the
radio
work
fine
and
much
less
jarring
than
beep
have
security
feature
that
convenient
small
and
lightweight
which
prefer
more
the
size
most
alarm
clock
the
biobrite
which
have
before
huge
take
the
entire
nightstand
and
finicky
fragile
and
complicated
like
the
size
and
feature
the

better
and
think
much
easier
use
one
change
would
make
less
bright
time

set
very

pick
the
radio

less

the
led
readout
large
and
clear
and
have
dimmer
switch
much
easier
see
and
read
than
the
more
common
lcd
display
controls
simple
and
self
explanatory
complex
confusing
manual
need
would
have
like
the
button
have
little
bit
larger
but
not
real
problem
like
the
fact
that
the
alarm
off
switch

you

about

great
there
second

set
one
time
for

easy
its
not
dealbreaker
the
other

that
lool
like
where
you
adjust
the

stay

the
time
clap
ignore
review
that
say
not
possible
constantly
keep
the
screen
display
they
have
take
the
time
figure
out
instead
give
bad
review
they
would
have
save
themselves
some
grief
the
cube
clock
measure
approx
small
however
after
watch
the
price
for
few
day
purchase
for
with
shipping
cost
you
want
for
cheaper
price
patient
you
want
then
and
now
for
cheap
that
you
problem
the
only
downside
see
with
this
product
more
likely
manufacturer
defect
and
user
error
buy
some
cheap
alkaline
battery
for
since
cheaper
buy
without
the
charger
and
after
few
day
use
the
display
random
and
longer
display
the
time
take
the
battery
out
and
reinsert
they
few
hour
later
the
same
thing
replace
the
battery
with
some
non
alkalie
higher
quality
duracell
after
few
day
without
use
this
seem
work
for
day
however
have
the
same
display
issue
the
next
day
and
leak
battery
acid
the
instruction
come
with
chinglish
best
throw
they
out
while
ago
however
the
device
likely
not
compatable
with
alkaline
battery
take
that
fault
behalf
give
this
clock
star
for
good
design
function
price
and
ease
use
lose
one
star
the
lack
readability
the
instruction
and
the
fact
that
have
throw
out
however
already
plan
buy
the
larger
wooden
led
clock
replacement
needless
say
would
buy
again
didd
not
buy
for
alarm
purpose
bought
keep
time
and
that
well
also
have
very
large
screen
for
easier
viewing
all
all
good
piece
buy
this
radio
christmas
present
for
office
mate
want
something
small
and
not
too
expensive
since
office
building
thing
can
disapear
the
reception
the
building
ususaly
not
good
and
that
concern
three
month
later
happy

exactly
what
husband

expect
great

easy

one
disappointment
work
from
power
line
not
battery
battery
only
preserve
setting
while
power
off
after
think
bit
understandable
why
display
big
and
therefore
energy
consuming
just
buy
this
very
same
travel
clock
for
plus
tax
local
hardware
store
have
not
try

hence
only
star
really
like
the
idea
this
clock
super
cute
and
love
how
you
could
move
the
leg

very
unique
the
only
con
find
from
this
product
the
alarm
sound
not
too
loud
deep
sleeper
would
not
get
waken
cute
suggestion
would
make
the
alarm
louder
and
maybe
make
the
alarm
the
starwars
theme
song
this
very
elegant
snooze
type
alarm
clock
with
many
different
soothing
sound
suit
you
taste
small

compact
come

live
its

new

wonderful
wife
hate
wake
phone
vibrate
night
stand
she
think
she
would
like
more
natural
approach
such
sunrise
personally
not
think
would
that
great
but
start
with
red
light
slowly
fading
bright
white
light
what
would
seem
merely
for
aesthetics
maybe
underestimate
red
light
much
softer
the
eye
than
white
logical
gradient
between
the
two
would
produce
gentle
awakening
plus
wake
due
light
source
naturally
stimulate
the
brain
lrb
and
turn
the
pineal
gland
rrb
reduce
the

melatonin
present

this
all
translate
into

always
set
half
hour
ahead
when
you
really
need
just
simply
lengthen
the

time
small
simple

and
not
cost
much
just
what
look
for
new
elgin
bedside

look
like
antique
but
require
wind
you
can
hear
the
slightest
tick
sound
which
like
brainer
set
the
only
thing
little
disappointed
with
think
have
light
dial
that
maybe
glow

major
complaint
about
this
clock
that
the
two
week
that
have
own
never
able
sync
with
the
atomic
clock
keep
try
every
night
and
never
succeed
since
return
not
worth
the
hassle
decide
open
and
look
inside
lrb
engineer
with
some
knowledge
how
these
circuit
work
rrb
surprise
find
that
the
the
circuit
inside
look
extremely
cheap
there
dry
solder
where
the
battery
wire
connect
the
circuit
board
the
antenna
lrb
for
the
radio
rrb
have
its
wire
short
everything
look
very
sloppy
general
then
manage
separate
the
short
the
antenna
hope
that
would
make
the
radio
work
luck
the
radio
sync
still
not
work
which
hardly
surprising
consider
that
the
antenna
itself
not
cleanly
wind
unevenly
wound
hand
not
machine
wound
mention
that
the
build
quality
horrible
not
know
the
clock
circuitry
have
support
for
manage
daylight
savings
have
reset
twice
year
find
out
about
month
guess
but
for
the
price
guess
decent
enough
clock
serve
purpose
maintain
time
fairly
accurately
and
have
thermometer
would
really
like
have
the
clock
sync
with
the
atomic
clock
via
the
radio
though
edit
lrb
jan
rrb
okay
the
radio
feature
finally
work
out

still
kind
flaky
work
sometimes
not

maybe
location
something
about
the
construction
apartment

give
five
star
only
have
not
open
the

shoddy
construction
cover
the
display
light
add
peice
dark

work
for
over
the
last

fix
hold

fine
take

one
complaint
that
when
the
clock
open
the
stand
very
long
and
juuuust
not
fit
standard
windowsill
have
have
this
clock
for
about
year
and
love
while
not
have
all
the
bell
and
whistle
the
more
expensive
clock
what
its
job
and
very
well
addition
have
small
problem
with
clock
and
even
though
never
send
warranty
card
the

amazing
about
help
out
and
get
replacement
would
highly
recommend
this
product
buy
this
sun
alarm
year
ago
and
have
make
huge
difference
how
feel
after
wake
the
morning
alarm
clock
use
make
feel
edgy
and
tense
but
wake
slow
simulated
dawn
really
peaceful
have
the
backup
radio
alarm
set
off
the
light
not
wake
but
far
have
only
need
that
maybe
handful
time
year
you
have
make
sure
the
alarm
eye
level
next
the
bed
for
work
really
well
though
the
only
gripe
really
have
that
there
way
dim
the
display
light
but
somewhat
complicated
and
everytime
the
power
off
lrb
which
lot
florida
rrb
have
look
again
but
other
than
that
this
decent
product
that
accomplish
the
goal
wake
peacefully
rrb
first
want
say
that
you
should
always
have
battery
powered
travel
alarm
clock
you
luggage
with
spare
battery
this
one
those
basic
must
haves
for
travel
have
stay
hotel
which
provide
clock
all
some
have
clock
with
alarm
some
have
plug
clock
and
then
the
power
out
some
have
really
complex
clock
that
you
can
not
figure
out
how
set
the
alarm
always
have
one
with
you
you
sure
that
you
wake
time
and
keep
track
you
schedule
there
plug
one
but
you
have
the
problem
converter
foreign
country
find
outlet
that
usefully
near
the
bed
and
again
power
outage
much
better
with
battery
power
one
like
the
fold
design
this
one
when
shut
the
display
and
button
all
protect
you
luggage
can
through
the
most
gorilla
like
baggage
claim
system
and
come
out
unscathed
the
unit
very
easy
use
simple
slider
set
the
alarm
off
and
you
get
visual
indicator
when
you
slide
another
lever
set
the
alarm
time
there
snooze
button
which
also
turn
the
light
temporarily
you
can
set
the
hour
and
minute
separately
which
great
improvement
over
system
that
make
you
cycle
slowly
through
hour
wrap
around
the
time
you
want
down
side
well
cheap
plastic
but
then
again
that
make
really
light
really
wish
always
lit
state
for
late
night
glance
but
that
would
probably
drain
the
battery
quickly
think
general
great
unit
for
the
price
have
use
for
quite
while
and
always
come
handy
even
the
time
have
not
need
nice
know
there
the
corner
the
the
look
the
clock
that
first
catch
attention
very
unusual
and
also
small
for
those
with
limited
space
the
time
easy
read
large
red
and
digital
all
the
button
the
back
you
not
have
surface
check
every
time
you
want
set
the
snooze
button
the
top
and
smaller
than
some
other
but
work
for
the
sound
very
clear
and
pleasant
alarm
clock
use
worst
enemy
not
anymore
have
have
the
for
about
week
and
thus
far
very
pleased
when
begin
shop
for
new
alarm
clock
primary
selection
criterion
that
have
lead
display
many
new
clock
have
multifunction
lcd
display
which
nice
except
that
you
can
not
see
they
the
dark
without
press
button
illuminate
they
like
lcd
wristwatch
alternatively
some
these
lcd
clock
have
projector
attachment
that
shine
time
display
the
wall
ceiling
but
you
can
not
see
they
well
lit
room
lead
display
visible
under
all
ambient
lighting
condition
and
seem
the
most
logical
and
straightforward
solution
once
the
universe
clock
narrow
lead
model
the
next
consideration
the
size
the
led
digit
they
run
anywhere
from
approximately
inch
inch
very
nearsighted
able
see
the
time
the
middle
the
night
without
glass
purely
case
the
bigger
the
better
the
have
digit
that
inch
high
bigger
than
most
other
led
clock
and
easily
readable
san
glass
obviously
the
larger
the
display
the
larger
the
clock
but
have
lot
room
nightstand
and
not
concern
with
the
somewhat
larger
than
usual
size
lrb
about
rrb
this
point
additional
useful
feature
the
only
other
necessary
evaluation
the
have
the
ability

whether
you
use
daylight
savings
time
and
the
clock
the
rest
can
report
that
from

this
work
perfectly
but
you
should
know
thing
first
have
find
that
the

the
clock
able
sucessfully

itself
lrb
but
have
sucessfully

rrb
only
complaint

minor
one

wake
easily
keep
make
these
clock
donna
they
have
change
this
clock
since
the
review
that
currently
list
most
helpful
the
small
change
that
now
use
battery
instead
one
cell
the
big
and
good
change
that
the

now
have
dimmer
switch
adjust
the

the
automatic

light
you
can
adjust
from
very
dim
brighter
than

light
the

itself
have
also
apparently
change
from
earlier

now
even
overall
green
light
dial
instead
hot
spot
light
you
can
still
also
push
the
snooze
button
get
very
bright
blue
light
the
bad
part
about
this
clock
the
hand
some
designer
must
have
think
they
would
give
some
sort
look
with
the
cut
out
design
the
hand
instead
the
functionality
solid
hand
the
cut
out
hand
make
very
difficult
see
the
time
night
with
the
back
lit
dial
because
the
light
come
through
the
hand
and
fuzz
they
out
able
see
the
time
require
that
you
turn
the
dial
light
way
which
very
annoying
opinion
fortunately
easy
fix
you
even
modestly
handy
pry
off
the
lens
with
very
small
screwdriver
either
the
clock
position
cut
some
black
electrician
tape
with
fine
scissors
acto
blade
span
the
open
cut
out
the
hour
and
the
minute
hand
and
apply
use
tweezers
position
and
apply
the
tape
gently
tamp
onto
the
hand
stick
the
whole
process
take
less
than
minute
and
now
easy
read

the
result
yeah

place
the

even
the

rrb
the

with

apply
this

save
its

but
will
not
wake
you
the
power
off
when
you
alarm
should
sound
mention
another
review
the
backup
battery
holder
cheap
and
oddly
support
this
force
enter
the
setting
the
first
time
move
the
clock
wire
the
holder
must
have
over
the
battery
contact
bent
away
and
seem
retain
the
setting
now
there
room
for
improvement
but
this
the
first
its
kind
and
what
need
maybe
the
upcome
executive
model
will
address
some
these
thing
regardless
happy
with
when
look
the
different
dawn
simulator
type
alarm
clock
really
discourage
the
price
all
they
not
want
something
too
cheap
nor
too
expensive
more
than
what
need
some
research
different
one
and
make
choice
between
the
sunrise
one
and
this
one
find
video
about
the
sunrise
one
and
the
white
noise
feature
seem
cool
but
like
the
sound
the
little
fan
have
better
and
also
not
have
worry
about
the
speaker
bad
for
the
white
noise
lrb
find
this
out
through
other
review
rrb
also
the
sunrise
one
huge
way
big
you
have
small
night
stand
with
the
soleil
lrb
which
think
still
high
for
simple
alarm
clock
rrb
could
not
stand
regular
one
with
the
loud
buzz
sound
wake
with
heart
racing
and
breathing
like
just
run
marathon
hate
wake
like
that
this
one
much
nicer
light
sleeper
far
the
other
review
about
not
bright
enough
you
want
spotlight
you
face
lrb
rhetorical
rrb
will
light
bright
enough
for
easy
awakening
only
problem
the
green
display
light
prefer
red
because
red
not
effect
the
diolation
the
eye
but
this
small
problem
far
the
radio
obviously
not
frickin
boom
box
but
good
enough
and
the
optional
beeping
sound
good
but
the
way
sleep
more
than
enough
not
even
use
the
light
enough
get
overall
this
alarm
clock
awesome
great
size
the
security
feature
cool
the
sunrise
sunset
awesome
too
and
just
read
the
instruction
and
play
with
bit
and
very
easy
use
would
recommend
this
lrb
course
they
really
light
sleeper
rrb
the
clock
work
fine
but
the
alarm
not
loud
enough
for
the
elderly
relative
purchase
for
you
need
clock
for
some
one
hard
hearing
search
for
the
sonic
boom
brand
what
end
purchase
replace
this
have
search
for
replacement
home
weather
station
and
find
one
that
work
however
the
time
display
about
inch
high
make
difficult
see
the
time
day
across
room
find
this
clock
and
perfect
the
number
about
inches
high
very
sharp
and
clear
read
across
room
use
this
clock
the
family
room
the
fireplace
mantle
the
brightness
the
number
not
factor
keep
anyone
awake
now
wear
glass
and
even
without
wear
the
glass
able
read
the
number
clearly
across
the
room
this
clock
also
have
indicator
very
happy
with
purchase
purchase
this
clock
because
old
clock
not
have
backup
battery
the
power
out
would
have
reset
clock
read
the
review
and
they
seem
pretty
good
receive
clock
today
and
right
out
the
box
the
clock
off
min
read
the
instruction
and
change
the
time
manually
unfortunately
when
set
the
time
manually
the
seconds
seconds
behind
accord
cell
phone
and
the
official
time
lrb
rrb
basically
have
wait
seconds
for
clock
change
after
cell
phone
change
not
the
end
the
world
right
but
figure
that
just
for
good
measure
would
call
the
manufacturer
the
woman
advise
how
set
the
clock
which
already
read
the
instruction
tell
she
that
other
clock
automatically
reset
the
seconds
zero
once
set
the
clock
all
other
clock
within
second
less
from
phone
ask
she
this
clock
can
reset
the
seconds
zero
she
not
know
and
advise
exchange
the
clock
think
might
defective
figure
with
name
like
acu
rrb
rite
they
would
accurate
just
sayin
other
than
the
fact
that
clock
will
seconds
off
the
atomic
clock
should
serve
purpose
for
the
blinking
turn
off
all
light
and
not
foresee
this
problem
and
this
clock
close
bed
the
light
not
intense
enough
annoying
but
bright
enough
see
easily
dark
well
light
room
will
make
another
review
the
performance
this
clock
should
fail
any
other
way
give
this
clock
star
rating
only
because
not
percent
accurate
like
they
make
out
might
able
resolve
this
issue
take
out
the
backup
battery
something
but
not
worth
the
time
take
find
small
screwdriver
try
can
live
with
the

with
that
the
sound
setting
fine
with
leave
the
and
that
just
fine
with
for
those
who
have
complain
about
the
brightness
the
display
screen
the
volume
imo
they
just
nitpicker
glad
that
buy
this
product
and
look
forward
many
year
use
you
the
market
for
this
type
alarm
clock
sound
machine
look
further
this
the
best
out
there
visually
this
dalek
alarm
clock
look
very
much
like
real
dalek
the
sound
effect
excellant
and
make
giggle
every
time
only
real
complaint
that
the
time
display
small
virtually
useless
unless
you
happen
within
the
thing
which
well
within
lethal
range
dalek
lrb
even
one
that
tall
rrb
the
projection
clock
work
well
but
would
more
useful
stay
continuously
this
product
would
better
have
the
option
plug
power
which
would
allow
for
continuous
wall
ceiling
display
the
projector
the
battery
only
nature
give
toy
like
feel
rather
than
that
real
usefully
functional
alarm
clock
course
the
point
the
thing
really
just
look
cool
and
get
some
grin
which
most
defintely
can
not
seem
walk
without
push
the
button
hear
say
exterminate
chuckle
every
time
this
replacement
for
previous
atomic

which
die
after
about
year
expect
another
year
reliable
service

this
one
far
